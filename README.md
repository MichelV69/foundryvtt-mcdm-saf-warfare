# SAF-Warfare

A **[FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/)** module that provides an implementation
of **[MCDM](http://www.mcdmproductions.com)'s** *Warfare rules* as seen in
[Strongholds & Followers](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/strongholds-followers)
(pp233). The module adds a special sheet for **NPC Actors** that designates them
as a unit and allows you to input any units created with the *Warfare rules*
system.

## *Nota Bene*

This project is not affiliated with **MCDM** and is in no way endorsed by them.

## You Been Forked

This is a **FoundryVTT v12.x** update of the original project by **Kim Mantas** (https://bitbucket.org/Fyorl/warfare).

I personally use **[Strongholds & Followers](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/strongholds-followers)**
in most of my **DnD5e** games in **FoundryVTT** and so when I noted the original
project was stale-versioned, I had to update it for my own use anyway. This
fork is to give back to the community and as thanks to **Kim Mantas** for
having done all the hard stuff for me.

## Sample Unit Cards

## Future Plans

It's my intent to slowly expand on the core functionality of this module to
allow for units to auto-calculate costs and similar behaviors.  Right now, as
"inherited" from the original fork, all it really does is give you an actor
sheet and let you role dice easily for common *Warfare* tests.
